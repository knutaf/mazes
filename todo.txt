DONE - draw grid with thin lines
DONE - draw grid with thick lines
DONE - choose start and end point
DONE - generate random points in grid with monotonic increasing path through maze from one side to the other
- generate random points and allow backtracking (though not overlapping)
DONE - track the points in the path through the maze
DONE - generate random walls for the other cells in the maze
- implement checker to tell if a cell is valid or not:
  DONE - each group of 4 cells in a square must have at least one inner wall
  DONE - every cell should be reachable
  - walls must be connected to N or more other wall sections
DONE - generate walls for other cells until valid
- allow start and end point to be on the same wall or whatever
- tighten up drawing (thick edges are badly aligned, upper-right corner has an empty gap, window border exceeds maze walls
- consider adding an option that allows only one valid path through the maze
