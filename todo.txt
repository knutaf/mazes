- draw grid with thin lines
- draw grid with thick lines
- choose start and end point on opposite walls
- generate random points in grid with monotonic increasing path through maze from one side to the other
- generate random points and allow backtracking (though not overlapping)
- track the points in the path through the maze
- generate random walls for the path through the maze
- generate random walls for the other cells in the maze
- implement checker to tell if a cell is valid or not (valid means exactly one or two exits from the cell)
- generate walls for other cells until valid
